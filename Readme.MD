### A backup of PlayerApi and RenderPlayerAPI forum posts in markdown

Archive.org links:

PlayerAPI: https://web.archive.org/web/20170914045249/http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/1277996-player-api

RenderPlayerAPI: https://web.archive.org/web/20170913033409/http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/1283669-render-player-api

Right now I'm focused on backing up the core documentation, the downloads will be archived later (you can also open a 
pull request if you want to help)
