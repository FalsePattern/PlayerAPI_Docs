Installation
============

Client
------

Copy all class files inside this ZIP file to their corresponding locations inside the JAR file of the Minecraft 1.6.4 version you want to install Player API render to.

Do NOT use the Minecraft 1.6.4 version "1.6.4". This is the default version which will be redownloaded after every change of yours.

In case no other Minecraft 1.6.4 version is present, create a new one by copying the Minecraft 1.6.4 default version directory "1.6.4" to a new directory (for example: "1.6.4.modded"). Make sure you also change the names of the two copied files and the value of the property "id" inside the copied JSON file accordingly.

And don't forget to make sure there is no "META-INF" folder inside your modded JAR file anymore.

In any case, NEVER forget: ALWAYS back up your stuff!


Server
------

Copy all class files inside this ZIP file to their corresponding locations in your "minecraft_server.1.6.4.jar".

In any case, NEVER forget: ALWAYS back up your stuff!
